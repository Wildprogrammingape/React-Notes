react官网对component的说明：

从概念上讲，组件就像JavaScript函数。它们接受任意输入（称为“ props”），并返回描述应该在屏幕上显示的内容的React元素。

components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.









补充资料：

Components are the core building block of React apps. Actually, React really is just a library for creating components in its core.

A typical React app therefore could be depicted as a component tree - having one root component ("App") and then an potentially infinite amount of nested child components.

Each component needs to return/ render some JSX code - it defines which HTML code React should render to the real DOM in the end.


*JXS只是JavaScript的语法糖，方便写看起来像是HTML的代码，return 后面加 JSX，而不是HTML

JSX is NOT HTML but it looks a lot like it. Differences can be seen when looking closely though (for example className in JSX vs class in "normal HTML"). JSX is just syntactic sugar for JavaScript, allowing you to write HTMLish code instead of nested React.createElement(...) calls.

When creating components, you have the choice between two different ways:

1. Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components - more about this later in the course) => const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> } (using ES6 arrow functions as shown here is recommended but optional)

2. class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components) => class Cmp extends Component { render () { return <div>some JSX</div> } }
