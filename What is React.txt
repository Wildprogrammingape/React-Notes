¸ÅÄî£º
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

ºÃ´¦£º
React applications run in the browser, not on the server. so the advantage is 
that we don't have to wait for a server response to get a new page or to render somthing new.

React     Vs      React DOM
React is all about components, while react dom is then about rendering these components to 
the real dom.
